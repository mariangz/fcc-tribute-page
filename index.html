            Óscar Alfonso Castro (born December 20, 1986 in Obregón, Sonora), better known as
            Caloncho, is a Mexican musician and singer. He studied high school at PrepaTec
            (Tecnológico de Monterrey's preparatory school) and graduated with a degree in
            International Relations from the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de
            Monterrey, Guadalajara Campus.

            As a child, Caloncho lived in Guadalajara where his favorite activity was playing the
            drums, until he later decided to experiment with melody. At the same time, he started
            playing the guitar that his grandfather had left for him years before, and soon learned
            to play songs from artists such as Bob Marley and Sublime. Based on his own confession,
            Caloncho was the name his grandfather and step-sister, Angélica, used to call him when
            he was very little and since the name never annoyed him, he decided to use it as his
            musical stage name.
