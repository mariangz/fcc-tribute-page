          Óscar Alfonso Castro (born December 20, 1986 in Obregón, Sonora), better known as
          Caloncho, is a Mexican musician and singer. He studied high school at PrepaTec
          (Tecnológico de Monterrey's preparatory school) and graduated with a degree in
          International Relations from the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de
          Monterrey, Guadalajara Campus.

        <p class="p">
          As a child, Caloncho lived in Guadalajara where his favorite activity was playing the
          drums, until he later decided to experiment with melody. At the same time, he started
          playing the guitar that his grandfather had left for him years before, and soon learned
          to play songs from artists such as Bob Marley and Sublime. Based on his own confession,
          Caloncho was the name his grandfather and step-sister, Angélica, used to call him when
          he was very little and since the name never annoyed him, he decided to use it as his
          musical stage name.
